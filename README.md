# One Life Git Repository

How many rated levels can you beat without dying ONCE?
One Life is a rogue-like challenge, where you're tasked with beating as many levels as you can without dying a single time. Start a run from the main menu, and choose the levels you play wisely! One mistake, and the run is over! 

Your run is scored in EXP, which is calculated based on the stats (Stars, Moons, Orbs, etc.) you accumulated during the run. Keep improving your best run, and challenge your friends to do better!
